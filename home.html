<p>
I am a Robot Vision researcher with expertise in 3D Perception, Sensor Fusion, and Computer Vision. Currently, I'm a Senior Applied Scientist working on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj1t3msy8dc"> Astro robot</a> at <b>Amazon Lab126</b>. My work focuses primarily on depth sensors and obstacle mapping algorithms.
</p>

<p>
Previously, I was a Computer Vision engineer in the <i>Home Applied Intelligence</i> team at <b>Apple</b>.
</p>

<p>
Prior to Apple, I built the <i>Depth Perception</i> stack for the <b>Lighthouse AI</b> camera which functions as a search engine for your home. Various media outlets (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-best-security-camera-for-most-people-1823895782">Gizmodo</a>, <a href="https://securitybaron.com/camera-reviews/lighthouse-indoor/">Security Baron</a> and many more) have rated Lighthouse as the best camera in the AI category. Check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzxLp8sB2vk">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
I graduated with a Ph.D. in Exploration Systems Design at Arizona State University. This website summarizes the various projects I worked on during my grad school. <b> To know about my more recent work, please contact me on LinkedIn. </b>
</p>

<p>
During my Ph.D., I was affiliated to the <a href="http://robotics.asu.edu", target="_blank">ASTRIL</a> lab headed by Prof. Srikanth Saripalli at the <a href="http://sese.asu.edu", target="_blank">School of Earth and Space Exploration</a>, Arizona State University. Prior to that, I was part of the 
<a href="http://robotics.iiit.ac.in", target="_blank">Robotics Research Center</a>, IIIT Hyderabad, headed by Prof. Madhava Krishna.

<!--
<p> My interests are Robot Perception and Planning and recently I have been working on Change detection using Airborne Systems. Also, I have been playing around with multi spectral near infra red camera of late.</p>
-->

<!--
<p> My research interests are broadly in the area of Robot Sensing. Consequently I have worked on 3D Perception, Probabilistic Robotics, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I am interested in building robust robotic systems 
through extensive field testing.

Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. </br> </br> <i> Mark Twain </i>

Failure or success seem to have been allotted to men by their stars. But they retain the power of wriggling, of fighting with their star or against it, and in the whole universe the only really interesting movement is this wriggle. </br> </br> <i> E.M. Forster </i>
